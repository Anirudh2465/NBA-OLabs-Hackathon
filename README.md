# NBA OLabs Hackathon Project

## Overview
This project is a modern, AI-powered interactive learning platform developed for the **OLabs Hackathon**. It enhances the traditional OLabs platform by integrating a **comprehensive knowledge base**, **AI-driven chatbot**, **subject-wise knowledge graphs**, **interactive simulations**, and **dynamic quizzes** to improve the learning experience.

## Features

### 1. **Enhanced Web-Based Learning Platform**
   - A **better version of OLabs** with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - Covers **all science streams (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics) for classes 9 to 12**.

### 2. **AI-Powered Chatbot**
   - The chatbot is trained on **all NCERT and reference textbooks** for classes 9 to 12.
   - Provides **instant answers** to student queries and explains concepts interactively.

### 3. **Subject-Specific Knowledge Graphs**
   - Each subject is represented as an **interactive knowledge graph**.
   - Users can navigate through **topics, key formulae, solved problems, and practice questions** from each node.

### 4. **Interactive Simulations for Physics & Chemistry**
   - The platform supports **real-time physics and chemistry simulations**.
   - Helps students **visualize and experiment** with scientific concepts.

### 5. **Quiz System**
   - Every topic and simulation ends with a **subjective and objective-based quiz**.
   - Reinforces learning through **concept-based assessments**.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React.js, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL
- **AI & Chatbot:** OpenAI API, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Simulations:** Three.js, WebGL, SciPy, ChemPy
- **Graph Representation:** D3.js for knowledge graphs
